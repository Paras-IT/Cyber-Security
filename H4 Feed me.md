# x) Why would you want to use a feed reader (and RSS/Atom)? Couldn't you just browse to each website?
  - Instead of visiting each website separately, a feed reader gathers new posts from all of your favorite websites in one location. You save time and effort by receiving a single stream of new content rather than having to monitor several websites for changes. Feed readers make sure you don't miss any significant postings or announcements by automatically retrieving updates as soon as they are released. RSS/Atom feeds remove clutter, pop-ups, and advertisements so you can concentrate on the content. In contrast to manually perusing websites, several feed readers allow you to download items for offline reading and arrange feeds by topic, priority, or tags. 

- In short, a feed reader makes the process faster, cleaner, and more reliable rather than browsing each website.



a) Install a feed reader. Show that it can read a feed (RSS or Atom). Include a screenshot of this. You can use any feed reader you like, and you can install the feed reader in your host OS if you like.
 - I installed Thunderbird with the commnad - sudo apt-get -y install thunderbird

b) Add the feed for Krebs. This is the one we discussed in the class. https://krebsonsecurity.com/feed/

c) Add a feed for Schneier on Security. Find the blog, and locate the feed.
  - Added the blog https://www.schneier.com/feed according to the instructions.

d) Find and add two more security related feeds. Explain how you found them, and why you chose them.
  - I googled and found this webiste https://rss.feedspot.com/cyber_security_rss_feeds/ , that lists Top 100 Cyber Security RSS Feeds (Security RSS) from where i chose https://thehackernews.com/ and https://www.darkreading.com/ because i am familiar with websites.
  
e) Follow security feeds for a while. What did you learn? What are the benefits and downsides of following feeds with a reader, compared to some other methods of following cyber security scene?
 - Following all the feeds i learned that it is so fast and precise to read and learn about the topics or the website i chose. Mostly i browse websites directly which is time consuming, feeds help me to identify the required information from the websites.
