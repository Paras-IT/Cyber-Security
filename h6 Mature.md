## h6 Mature tasks

 - x) Read and summarize
    - I have read and summarize a cybermeter user guide from Traficom, https://terokarvinen.com/kybermittari/files/Kybermittari_Cybermeter_User_Guide_V1.pdf
      1. In summary and checklist of the assessment process, there are key steps to initiate, prepare, conduct, develop and perform the required activities in an  organisation with management team, a facilitator and participants.
      2. In Cybermeter maturity model, there are 3 methods,
          - Level-Based Progression: Security maturity progresses from 0 (Unmanaged) to 3 (Managed), with each level requiring the complete implementation of all lower level procedures to ensure that there are no critical gaps.
          - Structured Assessment: Using certain objectives and practices, the model assesses 11 domains (such as risk management and incident response). To emphasise priority, a domain's final score is based on its weakest objective.
          - Foundational Rule: Maturity is assessed bottom to up practices determine objective scores, and the lowest objective score establishes the domain level, forbidding "skipping ahead" and enforcing methodical improvement.
      3. The repots of the Cybermeter maturity assessment are displayed in a radar chart that emphasis the pros and cons of an organization's cybersecurity posture by showing each domain's level side by side. It decribe how Cybermeter compares domain maturity levels and finds gaps by presenting data in a radar chart.
        
    - From the Traficom cybersecurity Maturity Assessment Tool, I got understanding as below https://terokarvinen.com/kybermittari/files/Kybermittarin%20arviointity%C3%B6kalu_v2.1_20230829.xlsx
      1. This is a Cybersecurity Maturity Assessment Tool developed to measure an organization’s cybersecurity maturity using the Cybermeter framework.
Organised into domains like risk management, identification & access, incident response, workforce, architecture, etc. Every domain contains goals and procedures that can be classified as either implemented or not.
      2. Domains define overall maturity, practices feed into objectives, and objectives feed into practices. Uses the 0–3 maturity levels, Provides a determined maturity level per domain and an overall score. Highlights weak regions by showing the lowest objective level in each domain.

 - a) Make-belief analysis. Write a short story for choosing a couple of subpoints in Kybermittari.
   - From the Cybermeter spreadhsheet, i choose a domain called ASSET (Asset, Change and Configuration management). There were 3 participants, Sari representing Management, Tomi from Administrations and Paras from Operation department. Assessmnet was carried out with topis like IT asset inventory, Information Asset inventory, Asset configurations, changes and activities. Most of the practice are well implented and there are some are for development also.
    - Some screenshots:

  - b) Sucks or succeeds. How could Kybermittari process be really useless? How could it be really useful?
     - If the Kybermittari procedure is viewed as paperwork that involves merely filling out a spreadsheet without an honest assessment or follow-up, the results may be disregarded and there may be no significant progress.
     - When used seriously as an organised self-assessment, it can assist organisations in identifying areas of weakness, enforcing methodical progress, and clearly communicating cybersecurity maturity through visual outputs such as radar charts.
   
  - c) Competition. What approaches, models or tools could compete with Kybermittari? Are there any benefits or downsides for those? Feel free to find your own sources.
     - There are some tools like NIST cybersecurity framework (CSF), Cybersecurity capability maturity model (C2M2), ISO/IEC 27001 and related standards which could be a competition of Cybermeter.
     - Benefits of Kybermittari: Free, available in several languages, localised for the Finnish and EU environment, based on NIST + C2M2 but simplified, simple to repeat.
     - Downsides of Kybermittari: Less global recognition, largely utilised in Finland, may lack the certification weight of ISO or NIST.
     - Global competitors like CSF, C2M2, ISO 27001 have recognition, structured frameworks, certification, and sector‑specific depth, but they are also complex, pricey, rigidity, or lack of localisation compared to Kybermittari’s lightweight, repeatable method.
