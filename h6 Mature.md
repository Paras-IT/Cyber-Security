 - x) Read and summarize
    - I have read and summarize a cybermeter user guide from Traficom, https://terokarvinen.com/kybermittari/files/Kybermittari_Cybermeter_User_Guide_V1.pdf
      1. In summary and checklist of the assessment process, there are key steps to initiate, prepare, conduct, develop and perform the required activities in an  organisation with management team, a facilitator and participants.
      2. In Cybermeter maturity model, there are 3 methods,
          - Level-Based Progression: Security maturity progresses from 0 (Unmanaged) to 3 (Managed), with each level requiring the complete implementation of all lower level procedures to ensure that there are no critical gaps.
          - Structured Assessment: Using certain objectives and practices, the model assesses 11 domains (such as risk management and incident response). To emphasise priority, a domain's final score is based on its weakest objective.
          - Foundational Rule: Maturity is assessed bottom to up practices determine objective scores, and the lowest objective score establishes the domain level, forbidding "skipping ahead" and enforcing methodical improvement.
